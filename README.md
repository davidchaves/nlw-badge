## ðŸ’» Project

The DoWhile Virtual Badge is a static application with the goal of showing the user information brought from the GitHub API and inserting it in a layout with the face of the DoWhile 2021 event.

Obs: This digital badge was created during the NLW/Heat event provided by @rocketseat-education. I was guided during 5 classes by [@maykbrito](https://github.com/maykbrito) and [@jakeliny](https://github.com/jakeliny).
